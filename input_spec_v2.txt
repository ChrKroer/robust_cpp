Each json file is a list of dictionaries, one dictionary for each constraint.

For quadratic constraints.
constraint_dict:
	name: constraint name in the MPS file
	type: type of constraint, linear/quadratic etc
	uncertainty: dictionary containing uncertainty information as follows
		type: type of uncertainty set, poly/L2ball etc
		dim: dimension of uncertainty set
		radius: (for L2Ball type) radius of L2ball
		data: dictionary containing data values for uncertainty
			base_matrix: (for quadratic type) dictionary containing information for base A matrix
				format: dense or sparse
				nrows: number of rows
				ncols: number of cols
				nnz: number of nonzero entries
				vals: list of coordinate (i,j,val) tuples
			matrices: (for quadratic type) list of dictionaries of the same format as base_matrix


For linear constraints.
constraint_dict:
	name: constraint name in the MPS file
	type: type of constraint, linear/quadratic etc
	nominal_coeff: dict of nominal coeffs by key=var_index, value=[coeff,varname]
	uncertainty: dictionary containing uncertainty information as follows
		dim: dimension of uncertainty set (i.e. number of uncertain coefficients)
		type: 'l2ball', 'supball'
		radius: (for LpBall type) radius of Lpball
		data: dict of nominal coeffs by key=var_index, value=[weight, varname].
			The uncertain coefficients vector a is defined by
			a = a0 + u
			where a0 is the vector of nominal coefficients, and u is from the set
			lpnorm(u/weight) <= radius.
			u/weight is the elementwise division of u_i and the corresponding weight_i from the dict.
